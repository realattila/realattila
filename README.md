ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @realattila

I am a problem solver, a creative and thoughtful person. I am always looking for challenges that I can solve using the skills I have. My hobbies are programming and online games.

i start programming when i was too young in 12 age with creating basic programming language, when i get into 18, started web developing , my major skill is frontend(reactjs)  but i write code for backend with nodejs in some projects, also i am good in Ui design and user experience. i  have 6 years experience at web developing. 

first challenge i solved was creating cryptocurrency exchange with other exchange API, next challenge i had was refactor cloud service CRM frontend with nextjs, it took 10 months.
my main tools are html,css, javascript, vscode, git, typescript, nodejs, linux.
